Just a guy coding... most likely poorly.

#### Things I like

* [Python](https://python.org) - I think this is a beautiful language. Simply just ["import this"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/#id3) to understand why
* [JavaScript](https://javascript.org) - because you are pretty much required to know it anymore! I am trying to decide if I should learn [Vue](https://vuejs.org/), [REACT](https://reactjs.org/), or [Angular](https://angular.io/).
* BPMN Tools like [Camunda](https://camunda.com) because I can build as fast as I think, then adapt quickly. [Zeebe by Camunda](https://zeebe.io/) is also very interesting.
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com) - document databases are very cool. Need to learn more about [Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/).
* [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) are two of my favorite opensource databases, I also really like [MSSQL](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/)
* [Docker](https://docker.com) and I need to learn [Kubernettes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)...
* [GO](https://golang.org/) - starting to get an interest in it....


and when I am required...

* [JAVA](https://www.java.com) for work
* [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) I used to use it ([C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) and [VB.NET](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/visual-basic/)) and think it is still a good platform... even VB.NET.

I should mention that I also love [Excel](https://products.office.com/en-us/excel). Really it is a great tool... just don't run your business on it.
