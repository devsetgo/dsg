# DevTools

This is a site I plan to add capabilities to help me or anyone else with simple productivity. I built the site based my starlette-dashboard project using AdminLTE 3.0.

[DevTools WebSite](https://devtools.devsetgo.com)

- PyPi checker: drop in your libraries and it will check for a new version
- Built it because it sucks to check one library at a time
- Thought it would be fun to track what I or anyone else is using
- Dashboard is for fun and learning
