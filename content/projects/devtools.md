# DevTools

This is a site I plan to add capabilities to help me or anyone else with simple productivity.

- PyPi checker: drop in your libraries and it will check for a new version
    - Built it because it sucks to check one library at a time
    - Thought it would be fun to track what I or anyone else is using
    - Dashboard is for fun
