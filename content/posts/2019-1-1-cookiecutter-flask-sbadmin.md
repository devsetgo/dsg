Cookiecutter is a template builder for Python applications. Steven Loria has a great and popular cookiecutter-flask that is a great starting point. I have been wanting to use a dashboard style bootstrap template called [SB Admin](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/sb-admin/). I have a couple projects I have been working to adapt the template too. The idea to create a cookiecutter came from looking back at Steven Loria's cookiecutter to work on flask-login and blueprints. So it just made sense to fork his project and adapt to my needs.

Would be happy for anyone to contribute to the project or [give it a try](https://github.com/devsetgo/cookiecutter-flask-sbadmin).
