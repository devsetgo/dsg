Some interesting stuff I've been reading about or looking into.

* [Flask Blueprints](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/blueprints/) - I've been reading about flask blueprints and building a basic template to utilize. Need to add in a User management with Flask-Login and my template should be done.
* [Kubernettes](https://kubernetes.io/) - This is the competitor to Docker Swarm. I will be using it at work. Still runs the docker enginer, but is supposed to be a better cluster management platform.
* [Camunda v7.10 Release](https://blog.camunda.com/post/2018/11/camunda-bpm-7100-released/) - Camunda released v7.10 of the engine. It now has "Tasklist-startable Process Definitions". They also just got "€25 million Series A from Highland Europe". So hopefully they will get moving on the [Zeebe](https://zeebe.io/) project faster.
* [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) - This looks really interesting. I wonder if it could help "speed up" Python websockets. Still learning about it, but seems interesting so far.
