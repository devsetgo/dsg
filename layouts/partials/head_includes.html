<!-- Placeholder template file

If you want to add CSS or JavaScript files from the site's static folder, copy this file into the site's folder
layouts/partials/ . 
Then add the URLs to your files as in the following example below this HTML comment. You can use Hugo's template engine 
with variables and all the nice functions as usual.

Example:
 The CSS file is found in: <site-folder>/static/css/site.css

This can be added to your website with:
 <link href="{{ .Site.BaseURL }}css/site.css" rel="stylesheet">

-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.6.3/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-UHRtZLI+pbxtHCWp1t77Bi1L4ZtiqrqD80Kn4Z8NTSRyMA2Fd33n5dQ8lWUE00s/" crossorigin="anonymous">
