      <description>At work we use Spring Cloud Config as part of are management of external dependencies for JAVA APIs. So I thought this would be useful to manage dependencies for Python applications also and an effective way of dealing with external environment variables when deploying a docker image as part of a Twelve Factor App.
Why is this important?
 You don&#39;t want to hardcode your configuration (keys, IP address, userid, passwords) Deploying .</description>

      <description>Cookiecutter is a template builder for Python applications. Steven Loria has a great and popular cookiecutter-flask that is a great starting point. I have been wanting to use a dashboard style bootstrap template called SB Admin. I have a couple projects I have been working to adapt the template too. The idea to create a cookiecutter came from looking back at Steven Loria&#39;s cookiecutter to work on flask-login and blueprints.</description>
