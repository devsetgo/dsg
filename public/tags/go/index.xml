      <description>Some interesting stuff I&#39;ve been reading about or looking into.
 Flask Blueprints - I&#39;ve been reading about flask blueprints and building a basic template to utilize. Need to add in a User management with Flask-Login and my template should be done. Kubernettes - This is the competitor to Docker Swarm. I will be using it at work. Still runs the docker enginer, but is supposed to be a better cluster management platform.</description>

      <description>So I broke my last site (or two). I had been using Wordpress and decided I wanted something light weight. So I started playing with Ghost and eventually had it running on my Docker instance. Initially I had it setup to learn and test, while also using it as my blog. Then I ran into a lot of issues&amp;hellip; way more than you should run into when learning/building a blog.</description>
